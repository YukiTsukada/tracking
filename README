##  Ca imaging with tracking protocol
##########################################


1. take thermograph with irMotion 

2. take background images with MetaMorph (Multi dimensional Acquisition)

3. save left and right corner coordinates with calibrate.m
(use calibrate.m twice with changing the produced file Right.mat-> Left.mat)

4. track and Ca image with curve_track.m (with MetaMorph)

5. take background images with the fixed worm and calibrate_background.m (with MetaMorph)

6. take thermograph with irMotion

7. Move the files: Thermograph x2, Coordinates, Left.mat, Right.mat
